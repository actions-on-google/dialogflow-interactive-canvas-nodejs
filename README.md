# Actions on Google: Interactive Canvas Sample

This sample demonstrates how to create an Interactive Canvas experience using Actions on Google for the Google Assistant -- using the [Node.js client library](https://github.com/actions-on-google/actions-on-google-nodejs) and deployed on [Cloud Functions for Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/) and [Firebase Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting).

## Setup Instructions
### Prerequisites
1. Node.js and NPM
    + We recommend installing using [nvm for Linux/Mac](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) and [nvm-windows for Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)
1. Install the [Firebase CLI](https://developers.google.com/actions/dialogflow/deploy-fulfillment)
    + We recommend using MAJOR version 6 with 6.5.0 or above, `npm install -g firebase-tools@^6.5.0`
    + Run `firebase login` with your Google account

### Configuration
#### Actions Console
1. From the [Actions on Google Console](https://console.actions.google.com/), add a new project > **Create Project** > under **More options** > **Conversational**
1. In the **Deploy** navigation section, click **Directory information**
    1. Under **Category**, select **Games & fun**
    1. Under **Immersive Canvas** *Do your Actions use Immersive Canvas?*, check **Yes**
1. From the left navigation menu under **Build** > **Actions** > **Add Your First Action** > **Play game** > **GET STARTED IN DIALOGFLOW** (this will bring you to the Dialogflow console) > Select language and time zone > **CREATE**.
1. In the Dialogflow console, go to **Settings** ⚙ > **Export and Import** > **Restore from zip** using the `agent.zip` in this sample's directory.

#### Firebase Deployment
1. On your local machine, in the `functions` directory, run `npm install`
1. Run `firebase deploy --project {PROJECT_ID}` to deploy the function and hosting
    + To find your **Project ID**: In [Dialogflow console](https://console.dialogflow.com/) under **Settings** ⚙ > **General** tab > **Project ID**.

#### Dialogflow Console
1. Return to the [Dialogflow Console](https://console.dialogflow.com) > select **Fulfillment** > **Enable** Webhook > Set **URL** to the **Function URL** that was returned after the deploy command > **SAVE**.
    ```
    Function URL (dialogflowFirebaseFulfillment): https://${REGION}-${PROJECT_ID}.cloudfunctions.net/dialogflowFirebaseFulfillment
    ```
1. From the left navigation menu, click **Integrations** > **Integration Settings** under Google Assistant > Enable **Auto-preview changes** >  **Test** to open the Actions on Google simulator then say or type `Talk to my test app`.

### Running this Sample
+ You can test your Action on any Google Assistant-enabled device on which the Assistant is signed into the same account used to create this project. Just say or type, “OK Google, talk to my test app”.
+ You can also use the Actions on Google Console simulator to test most features and preview on-device behavior.
+ To hide the debug overlay, uncomment the code below `/* Uncomment below to disable the debug overlay */` in `public/css/main.css`.
